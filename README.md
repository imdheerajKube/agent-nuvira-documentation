## Why Agent-Nuvira? (The Core Edge)

- **🎯 Understands what you asked — then shows you the contract before it runs** — every
  request in `chat`, `execute`, `plan`, and `edit` resolves through one shared understanding
  layer: a deterministic rule fast-path (<5ms, works offline) with LLM verification behind it,
  collapsing to a single action every command consumes identically. Before any work begins,
  Agent-Nuvira prints a 🧠 Understanding card — the resolved goal, target, scope, acceptance
  criteria, and risk flags — so the request is **seen before it is run**. The live activity
  board then renders each agent step as it happens — no black box, no silently
  half-understood goals
- **🛠️ Execution that repairs itself** — a failed task is not just reported: failures are
  classified, automatically repaired with escalating retries, independently verified after the
  fix, and the lesson is stored in persistent failure memory so the same mistake is less likely
  next time. Runs finish — or they tell you exactly why and what to do next
- **🪙 Model-First Smart Routing** — stop paying flat premium fees. Nuvira dynamically routes every task across **22 providers** and **300+ discovered models** using **model-first scoring** (not provider-first). Each model is scored on 6 dimensions: cost per million tokens, capability fit, health, quota availability, provider speed, and verification status. The router picks the BEST MODEL for the task, then finds which provider serves it cheapest. **Tiered failover** with quota pre-check: same model → same tier → escalate → de-escalate → local → neural response. **1-token warmup daemon** keeps frequently-used models hot. A **central quota ledger** tracks tokens per provider × model with calendar-aware reset windows, parks exhausted providers until free quota resets, and **auto-fails-over mid-session** when a token expires or a rate limit hits — never a stuck session, never a quota error thrown at you
- **🧠 Learning Router that gets better with use** — a Thompson-sampling bandit learns per provider × complexity bucket from *real* task outcomes (cost-adjusted rewards), with hard constraints (`maxCostUsd`, `minSpeed`, `minReasoning`), regex routing rules, uncertainty-driven escalation when the bandit has no data, and **promotion gates** that only keep router changes that measurably improve quality without regressing cost
- **🐝 17 Specialized Agent Swarm** — no generic single-prompt boxes. Your goal is decomposed into a DAG of tasks handled by dedicated agents working in parallel: Planner, Context-Gatherer, Writer, Reviewer, Runner, Tester, Debugger, Security Auditor, Git/GitLab specialist, Package installer, PR Reviewer, Issue Triage, Branch Automation, and more
- **⚡ Deterministic Tier-0 routing** — mechanical edits (remove `console.log`, rename symbols, dedupe imports) complete in **<1ms for $0**, AST-validated before apply, and never touch an LLM unless the goal genuinely needs one
- **🧠 Local FAISS Context Indexing** — blazing-fast, private, semantic code search and retrieval with an optional **native FAISS backend** (pure-JS fallback) that strictly respects your `.gitignore`. Retrieval shrinks a 20k-token gathered context to the top-k relevant chunks — saving tokens so free quotas stretch further
- **📌 Persistent project memory** — facts, preferences, and trajectories are stored per project and recalled automatically in later sessions; memory is pluggable (local by default, external backends optional)
- **🔌 First-Class MCP Integration** — seamlessly connect to Jira, Slack, PostgreSQL, GitHub Issues, and file systems using standard Model Context Protocol servers with SSE transport
- **👥 Real-Time Team Collaboration** — share context, synchronized vector indices, custom agents, and review pipelines across your engineering team via Git-synced config and memory
- **🎨 Adaptive Modality Routing** — intelligent routing for image/audio/video with failover across backends. **Data-driven providers** — add new providers via config, no code changes required. Image: ComfyUI (free) → Pollinations (free) → DALL-E (paid) → Stability (paid). TTS: OpenAI TTS (paid) → ElevenLabs (paid). Video: FAL (paid) → Runway (paid). Transcription: OpenAI Whisper (paid). Users can add custom providers:
  ```bash
  # Add Replicate for image generation
  nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.apiKey=r8_xxxxx
  nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.baseUrl=https://api.replicate.com/v1
  nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.models="stability-ai/sdxl"
  
  # Add Azure TTS
  nuvira config set modality.tts.azure.apiKey=xxxxx
  nuvira config set modality.tts.azure.region=eastus
  ```
- **🖥️ Runs anywhere** — zero native dependencies, tested on macOS / Windows / Linux (3,806 tests), no server, no telemetry, no subscriptions, and bring-your-own-keys for every provider. For the reasoning behind the architecture, see the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) document.

## Features

- **Unified interface** across 17+ providers: 5 built-in (local/Ollama, Groq, NVIDIA NIM, Google Gemini, OpenRouter) + 12 configurable via environment variables (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Cohere, Together, DeepInfra, Fireworks, Perplexity, Azure, LM Studio, Anyscale, vLLM)
- **Model discovery** — `agent-nuvira models` lists available models from any configured provider, with search/filter support
- **Interactive chat** with conversation history, file context, and session commands
- **AI-assisted file editing** with dry-run mode for safe previews
- **Codebase planning** that analyzes directory structure and generates implementation plans
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — `agent-nuvira execute "goal"` runs a pipeline of planner, gatherer, writer, reviewer, tester, and more
- **Response caching** via SQLite to reduce costs and latency
- **Plugin system** with auto-discovery — drop `.js` files into `~/.nuvira/plugins/` for automatic loading
- **Project scaffolding** — `agent-nuvira init` generates starter projects with interactive template + provider selection
- **Context-preserving model switching** — `agent-nuvira model switch` changes providers mid-session without losing agent state
- **Auto model routing** — `agent-nuvira model switch auto` lets the agent pick the best provider/model for every task based on complexity, cost, latency, privacy, and reliability (with fallback chains + circuit-breaker awareness). Cost scoring uses **real per-1K-token provider pricing** (overridable via `agent-nuvira config set pricing.<provider>.inputPer1K`), adjusted at runtime by **benchmark quality + per-agent best-model stats**. See why a decision was made with `agent-nuvira model explain` (or `--json` for CI) — walk through a full decision with the 🎯 fit / 📏 measured / ⏳ ctx chips in `MODELS_EXPLAIN_DEMO.md`. Benchmark the router's exact picks with `agent-nuvira benchmark --routing`, validate them end-to-end with `agent-nuvira eval --routing`, and track actual picks + a full audit trail in the dashboard's **Routing** panel
- **Learned-from-real-usage telemetry** — every LLM call (chat, execute, plan, edit, skill, learn, ci, doctor) writes through to the Model Availability Registry **with its action tag**, so the registry learns which provider × model each action **killed** (predictive skip) or **verified** (routable) from real usage — not just probes. `agent-nuvira models status --verbose` prints registry-blocked providers + per-action verified/killed chips, and the dashboard's **Models** panel shows the same per-action feed with a daily timeline chart. A provider killed by ANY action is skipped predictively by all others; a later real success re-verifies it and un-parks it (the recovery loop), and `agent-nuvira models unblock <provider>` is the manual escape hatch (demotes the block, clears quota parks + ledger cooldown, then re-probes the live API with an honest `stillBlocked` verdict — `--json` for CI). Proven end-to-end by a hermetic `tests/e2e/` test (mock 429 provider → registry learns → next pick skips). The **VS Code extension** attributes its usage too — every IDE-driven call (chat panel → `ide-chat`, inline suggestions → `ide-inline`, execute/edit/workflow → `ide-<command>`) is tagged via `BUFF_TELEMETRY_ACTION` at spawn, so the same per-action panel shows IDE usage as its own rows
- **Skill compiler** — automatically extracts reusable patterns from successful agent runs into executable skills (`agent-nuvira skill run`)
- **Context-window memory pruner** — prevents long multi-agent chains from exceeding model token limits
- **Complete streaming support** — all 17+ providers support real-time token-by-token output
- **Cost tracking** — per-provider/session/monthly costs with `agent-nuvira stats cost`
- **Prompt history search** — keyword and semantic search across past conversations (`/search`, `agent-nuvira history`)
- **Native embedding support** — 3-tier embedder with `@huggingface/transformers` for 10x faster semantic search
- **Workflow template marketplace** — 10 built-in templates + GitHub registry with install/publish lifecycle
- **Model benchmarking** — 21 standardized coding tasks with scoring and A/B comparison
- **Docker sandbox isolation** — resource-limited, network-isolated container execution with 8 base images
- **Provider health dashboard** — `agent-nuvira doctor` with color-coded status, watch mode, and auto-fix
- **Memory compression & pruning** — automatic trajectory summarization with configurable retention policies
- **VS Code extension** — Chat Panel with streaming responses, slash commands, and session history;
  Diagnostic → AI Fix from lightbulb menu; Code Lens actions (Test/Review/Explain/Fix) above functions
  and classes; 9 commands, inline code suggestions, diff viewer, agent progress panel
- **22-platform multi-channel gateway** — `agent-nuvira gateway start / send / status / alias` runs the agent from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp (Cloud API + Baileys personal bridge), Email, Signal, DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom, Mattermost, Matrix, generic Webhook, BlueBubbles (iMessage), ntfy, Teams, Google Chat, Weixin, SMS (Twilio), IRC (two-way), SimpleX (two-way),  and Home Assistant — all opt-in via standard env vars per platform, with a guaranteed delivery ledger (auto-retry on `agent-nuvira gateway start`), the dashboard Channels send-test, and a `X/22 platforms configured` status line
- **Remote agent federation** — multi-machine collaboration with protocol, server, and client
- **Web UI dashboard** — React dashboard with DAG visualization, model health, cost charts, and history browser
- **Hybrid model routing** — intelligent model selection based on task complexity, cost, and availability
- **Team collaboration** — Git-synced shared config, memory, and review pipelines
- **Agent SDK** — `@agent-nuvira/sdk` npm package for building custom agents with scaffolding CLI
- **Provider CLI** — `agent-nuvira provider list` with color-coded status table, `agent-nuvira provider health` with per-provider diagnostics
- **Provider fallback routing** — automatic failover between providers with circuit breaker and configurable chain
- **Startup progress feedback** — first launch never looks like a silent hang: a live spinner reports each startup phase (plugins → history & search → semantic index) as it runs
- **Auto-mode session failover** — in Auto routing, a provider whose API key/token expires or rate-limits mid-session is automatically swapped for the next-best provider (auth failures excluded for the session, rate-limit failures for a 120s cooldown, 5xx/network through the circuit breaker) — no more stuck sessions on a dead key
- **Central quota ledger** — tokens/requests per provider × model with calendar-aware reset windows; exhausted providers are **parked** until the window rolls (auto re-enable, no timers), and Auto routing sinks parked providers below healthy candidates **before** a call — plus an optional free/local-first `allowPaid` gate and a `agent-nuvira model quota` CLI with a cost summary (free vs paid tokens + estimated $ saved)
- **Learning Router CLI** — `agent-nuvira model bandit` inspects the Thompson-sampling state (α/β priors per provider × complexity bucket, expected win %, learning history, `--json` for CI) and `agent-nuvira model bandit reset` clears it; routing decisions record a `routedBy` source (`heuristic | rule | bandit`) for full auditability
- **Routing rules & hard constraints** — regex/string task-pattern rules force a provider/model before scoring (first match wins); per-call filters (`routing.maxCostUsd`, `routing.minSpeed`, `routing.minReasoning`) *eliminate* violating providers with a safe fallback when constraints would remove everything
- **Deterministic Tier-0 routing** — mechanical edits short-circuit the LLM entirely (strip `console.*` lines, word-boundary symbol renames, import dedupes) with AST validation and graceful fallthrough to the LLM when a goal isn't mechanical — `$0` and `<1ms` per edit
- **Native FAISS vector backend** — `agent-nuvira memory backend` shows the active backend (`faiss-native` / `faiss-ivf` / `json`) and why it was chosen; `--check` runs a native-FAISS availability probe with install guidance, and `@faiss-node/native` is used automatically whenever it builds
- **Vector retrieval (token-efficient context)** — large gathered contexts are chunked, embedded locally (`bge-small-en-v1.5` via @huggingface/transformers, zero new deps) and reduced to the top-k semantically-relevant chunks before the LLM call — saving tokens so free quotas stretch further. Complements the quota ledger: **retrieval saves tokens, the ledger manages quotas**. Small contexts pass through untouched (zero overhead); any retrieval failure fails over to full context. `agent-nuvira retrieval index/query/stats/clear` + a dashboard Retrieval card show the savings
- **Checkpoint / resume** — `agent-nuvira execute "<goal>" --checkpoint` saves a resume-able snapshot after every task batch; `--resume [id]` rehydrates the plan and continues from the first pending step (a crash / quota kill / token expiry mid-pipeline no longer restarts the whole plan); `--checkpoint-list` shows saved pipelines
- **Security scan CLI** — `agent-nuvira security scan` detects PII, prompt injections, and dangerous code patterns
- **Feedback & rating system** — `agent-nuvira feedback record/list/stats/clear` drives self-improvement scoring
- **Marketplace unified CLI** — `agent-nuvira marketplace browse/search/install/info` for workflow templates + plugins
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration** — connect to databases, APIs, and file systems via MCP servers with SSE transport support
- **AST-aware code editing** — structural analysis engine understands functions, classes, methods across JS/TS/Python/Go/Rust
- **Auto error-repair engine** — automatic diagnosis and repair of test failures with configurable retry budgets
- **Cross-platform dependency installer (Runner)** — auto-detects 11 manifest types (npm/pnpm/yarn with
  lockfile-first priority, pip, bundler, cargo, go, composer, dart pub), installs missing project dependencies
  on failed commands, and bootstrap-installs missing package managers (npm, pip, bundler, cargo, go, composer,
  dart, Homebrew) via brew/apt/dnf/yum/winget/choco/rustup — no manual setup required
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol** — inter-agent communication standard for multi-machine collaboration
- **CI/CD headless mode** — `agent-nuvira ci` for automated pipelines with GitHub Actions integration
- **npm publishing & one-line install** — `npx agent-nuvira` and `npx buff` for zero-setup onboarding
- **Marketing website** — `website/` directory with a full landing page, SEO meta tags, and Netlify-ready deployment config
- **Branch Automation Hooks (Pillar A4)** — `agent-nuvira execute "install branch hooks" --auto-branch` installs
  git post-checkout and pre-commit hooks for automated branch workflows; issue-driven branch creation
  (`feat/PROJ-123-description`), PR label-triggered updates, file-watch auto-commit with conventional
  commit messages, and CI failure detection with LLM diagnosis
- **Issue Triage Engine (Pillar A3)** — Automated issue classification, prioritization, and labeling
  across GitHub and GitLab via `agent-nuvira execute "triage issues"` with LLM-powered analysis

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+ and **npm**
- **TypeScript** knowledge for development; none required to use the CLI

### Install

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g agent-nuvira

# Or clone and build from source
git clone https://github.com/imdheerajKube/agent-nuvira.git buff
cd agent-nuvira
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

### One-command setup for new users (recommended)

If you're setting up on a **fresh machine** (or just don't want to deal with
installing Node.js, Git, build tools, etc. by hand), use the platform setup
script. Each one **checks for the required tools, installs anything missing
for you, installs Agent-Nuvira, and then asks whether you want the optional
performance upgrades** (native FAISS + local embeddings) — with plain-English
prompts the whole way.

| OS | Run this |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imdheerajKube/agent-nuvira/main/scripts/setup/install-macos.sh)` |
| **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora/RHEL/Arch/Alpine) | `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imdheerajKube/agent-nuvira/main/scripts/setup/install-linux.sh)` |
| **Windows** (PowerShell) | `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imdheerajKube/agent-nuvira/main/scripts/setup/install-windows.ps1 | iex` |

What each script does:

1. **Detects what's missing** — Node.js, npm, Git, build tools (and Homebrew on
   macOS / `winget` on Windows), and installs them automatically (with your
   confirmation) using the right installer for your OS.
2. **Installs Agent-Nuvira** — `npm install -g agent-nuvira` (with npm 11's
   install-script security gate handled automatically so native components build).
3. **Asks about optional upgrades** (recommended, each a yes/no):
   - **Native FAISS** → faster semantic search / memory recall
   - **Local embeddings** → free, offline, private embeddings (no cloud call)
4. **Verifies** the install and prints next steps.

> The scripts are safe to re-run — they skip tools that are already present.
> Manual install instructions for every step are below for those who prefer
> full control.

### Native FAISS acceleration (optional, recommended)

Agent-Nuvira includes an optional native FAISS backend for faster semantic retrieval. The runtime prefers this backend automatically when the native addon can build successfully; if that path is unavailable, it falls back to the pure-JS IVF implementation and then the exact JSON backend so your workflow stays reliable.

> **How the auto-selection works:** At load time, `createFaissBackend()`
> attempts to import `@faiss-node/native` and run a 1-vector smoke test.
> If the native addon exists and passes the smoke test, the backend is
> `faiss-native`. If the import fails (not installed, build error, or wrong
> API), it falls back to the pure-JS IVF-flat ANN (`faiss-ivf`). If that
> also fails to initialize, the exact JSON backend (`json`) is used as the
> final safety net — semantic search NEVER breaks.

For npm-installed users, the setup is:

```bash
# 1) Install the CLI
npm install -g agent-nuvira

# 2) Install the native build prerequisites (macOS example)
brew install faiss libomp openblas

# 3) Rebuild the optional native addon
npm rebuild @faiss-node/native

# 4) Enable the FAISS-style backend (or leave it on 'auto' to prefer it automatically)
#    'auto' (default) — tries native FAISS first, then pure-JS IVF, then JSON
#    'faiss'         — prefer FAISS-style (native or pure-JS IVF); JSON fallback
#    'json'          — exact flat cosine (the original behavior, no FAISS at all)
agent-nuvira config set memory.vectorBackend auto
# or force it explicitly:
# agent-nuvira config set memory.vectorBackend faiss
```

If you want to confirm the backend in use:

```bash
agent-nuvira memory stats                    # Shows active backend
agent-nuvira memory backend                  # Active backend name + why it was chosen
agent-nuvira memory backend --check          # Same + native availability probe + install guidance
```

### Understanding the FAISS tiers

| Tier | Backend name | When it's used | Performance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Native FAISS** | `faiss-native` | `@faiss-node/native` installed AND built successfully | Fastest — real FAISS C++ bindings |
| **2 — Pure-JS IVF** | `faiss-ivf` | Native not available; runs TypeScript port of FAISS IndexIVFFlat | Approximate ANN; sub-linear search for large indexes |
| **3 — Exact JSON** | `json` | Both FAISS paths unavailable; flat cosine scan | Exact results; O(n) linear scan |

The pure-JS IVF tier uses deterministic k-means++ clustering (nlist=sqrt(n)),
inner product of L2-normalized vectors (= cosine similarity), and nprobe probe
lists. For small indexes (≤ 512 entries) it runs an exact scan so results are
identical to the JSON backend. Filter-aware probe expansion ensures that
metadata filters don't miss results.

If the native addon cannot be built on your machine, Agent-Nuvira will continue to work using the pure-JS fallback path.

### Local embeddings (optional, recommended)

Semantic search and memory recall use embeddings. Agent-Nuvira's embedder has a
3-tier strategy and **always prefers the local tier when it works**:

| Tier | Engine | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Local** | `@huggingface/transformers` (`onnxruntime-node`) | Free, offline, private — `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim). **Default when available** |
| **2 — Python** | `sentence-transformers` via subprocess | Used when Tier 1 is unavailable and Python is present |
| **3 — LLM** | Any configured inference provider | Last-resort fallback; costs tokens |

With `@huggingface/transformers` installed and its native binary present, no
configuration is needed — local embeddings are used automatically, offline,
with zero API cost. The one-command setup scripts above enable this for you.
To verify which tier is active, run:

```bash
agent-nuvira memory backend --check
```

### Verify

```bash
agent-nuvira --help
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Configuration

MCP servers extend your agent's capabilities by connecting to external tools and data sources — databases, APIs, file systems, search engines, code repositories, and more. Agent-Nuvira supports the MCP standard for discovering and invoking tools from connected servers.

### Configuration Files

MCP server configs are JSON files placed in '~/.nuvira/mcp/'. Each file defines one server connection. Files are auto-discovered at startup.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.nuvira/mcp
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique name for this server connection |
| `transport` | `"stdio"` or `"sse"` | Yes | Transport protocol (stdio for local subprocess, sse for remote HTTP) |
| `command` | string | For stdio | The command to run (e.g., `npx`, `node`, a binary path) |
| `args` | string[] | For stdio | Command arguments |
| `url` | string | For sse | The SSE endpoint URL (e.g., `https://example.com/mcp`) |
| `headers` | object | Optional | Custom HTTP headers for SSE transport (e.g., `Authorization`) |
| `env` | object | Optional | Environment variables for the stdio subprocess |
| `enabled` | boolean | Yes | Set to `false` to temporarily disable the server |

### Transport Types

#### stdio (Local Subprocess)

Spawns a local process (Node.js, Python, Go binary, etc.) and communicates via stdin/stdout using JSON-RPC 2.0.

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."],
  "enabled": true
}
```

#### sse (Remote HTTP)

Connects to a remote HTTP endpoint using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Supports custom headers for authentication.

```json
{
  "name": "exa",
  "transport": "sse",
  "url": "https://websetsmcp.exa.ai/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_EXA_API_KEY"
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Examples

#### 1. Filesystem Server

Read/write files and directories on your local machine.

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/your/project"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

```bash
agent-nuvira mcp connect filesystem
agent-nuvira mcp call read_file --server filesystem --args '{"path":"/path/to/file.txt"}'
```

#### 2. GitHub Server

Search repositories, issues, PRs, and code on GitHub. Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token.

**Setup:**
1. Build the binary: `git clone https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server.git && cd github-mcp-server && go build -o github-mcp-server ./cmd/github-mcp-server/`
2. Move it to your PATH: `mv github-mcp-server /usr/local/bin/`
3. Create a GitHub PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens
4. Add the config below to '~/.nuvira/mcp/github.json'

```json
{
  "name": "github",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "/usr/local/bin/github-mcp-server",
  "args": ["stdio"],
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

```bash
agent-nuvira mcp connect github
agent-nuvira mcp list
# Tools include: search_repositories, search_issues, search_code, search_pull_requests, etc.
agent-nuvira mcp call search_repositories --server github --args '{"query":"react","limit":5}'
```

#### 3. Exa WebSets Server (SSE with Bearer Auth)

Search and enrich web entities (companies, people, research papers) using Exa's AI-powered search API. Uses SSE transport with Bearer token authentication.

**Setup:**
1. Get your Exa API key at https://dashboard.exa.ai
2. Add the config below to '~/.nuvira/mcp/exa.json'

```json
{
  "name": "exa",
  "transport": "sse",
  "url": "https://websetsmcp.exa.ai/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_EXA_API_KEY"
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

```bash
agent-nuvira mcp connect exa
agent-nuvira mcp list
# Tools include: create_webset, create_search, create_enrichment, list_websets, etc.
```

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `agent-nuvira mcp list` | List all discovered MCP servers and their tools |
| `agent-nuvira mcp connect <name>` | Connect to a specific MCP server |
| `agent-nuvira mcp connect --all` | Connect to all discovered MCP servers |
| `agent-nuvira mcp call <tool> --server <name> --args '{"key":"val"}'` | Call a tool on a connected server |
| `agent-nuvira mcp info <name>` | Show detailed information for an MCP server |
| `agent-nuvira mcp refresh` | Re-discover and reconnect to all MCP servers |

### Auto-Discovery with the Orchestrator

When you run `agent-nuvira execute`, the orchestrator automatically:

1. Scans '~/.nuvira/mcp/' for JSON config files
2. Connects to all enabled MCP servers
3. Injects tool descriptions into the agent's context
4. The planner can schedule MCP tool calls as pipeline steps

### Finding More MCP Servers

Browse the official MCP server directory at **[modelcontextprotocol.io/servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/servers)**. Popular servers include:

- **Filesystem** — Read/write local files
- **GitHub** — Repository, issue, PR, and code search
- **PostgreSQL** — Query databases
- **SQLite** — Query SQLite databases

## Configuration

### Config File

Configuration lives at `~/.nuvira/nuvirarc.json`. It is created with sensible defaults on first use.

You can inspect and modify it through the CLI:

```bash
# Show full configuration
agent-nuvira config

# Set the default provider
agent-nuvira config set defaultProvider gemini

# Set a provider's model
agent-nuvira config set providers.nim.model "meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

# List all providers with their status
agent-nuvira config list
```

### Default Configuration

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "local",
  "providers": {
    "nim": {
      "model": "meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 4096
    },
    "gemini": {
      "model": "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 8192
    },
    "openrouter": {
      "model": "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 4096
    },
    "groq": {
      "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 4096
    },
    "local": {
      "runner": "ollama",
      "model": "llama2",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 4096
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

API keys can be set via environment variables instead of the config file. They take **priority** over the config file.

| Variable | Provider | Required? | Get Your Key |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq | Yes, unless using local | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |
| `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY` | NVIDIA NIM | Yes, unless using local | [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini | Yes, unless using local | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter | Yes, unless using local | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |

You can place a `.env` file in the project root or at `~/.nuvira/.env`:

```env
# ~/.nuvira/.env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### Modality Providers (Image/Audio/Video)

Agent-Nuvira routes image generation, TTS, video, and transcription to the best available backend. Built-in providers are automatically detected from environment variables. You can add custom providers via config:

```bash
# Add Replicate for image generation
agent-nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.apiKey=r8_xxxxx
agent-nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.baseUrl=https://api.replicate.com/v1
agent-nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.models='["stability-ai/sdxl", "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell"]'
agent-nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.costPerUnit=0.003
agent-nuvira config set modality.image.replicate.quality=0.9

# Add Azure TTS
agent-nuvira config set modality.tts.azure.apiKey=xxxxx
agent-nuvira config set modality.tts.azure.baseUrl=https://eastus.tts.speech.microsoft.com
agent-nuvira config set modality.tts.azure.endpoint='/cognitiveservices/v1'
agent-nuvira config set modality.tts.azure.models='["en-US-AriaNeural", "en-US-JennyNeural"]'

# Add custom video provider
agent-nuvira config set modality.video.myprovider.apiKey=xxxxx
agent-nuvira config set modality.video.myprovider.baseUrl=https://api.myprovider.com/v1
agent-nuvira config set modality.video.myprovider.models='["model-1"]'
```

**Built-in providers (auto-detected from env vars):**

| Modality | Provider | Env Var | Cost | Quality |
|----------|----------|---------|------|----------|
| Image | Pollinations.ai | None (free) | Free | 0.7 |
| Image | DALL-E 3 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | $0.04/image | 0.95 |
| Image | Stability AI | `STABILITY_API_KEY` | $0.002/gen | 0.85 |
| Image | ComfyUI (local) | `BUFF_IMAGE_API_URL` | Free | 0.9 |
| TTS | OpenAI TTS | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | $15/1M chars | 0.9 |
| TTS | ElevenLabs | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | $30/1M chars | 0.95 |
| Video | FAL AI | `FAL_KEY` | $0.05/video | 0.85 |
| Video | Runway ML | `RUNWAY_API_KEY` | $0.10/video | 0.95 |
| Transcription | OpenAI Whisper | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | $0.006/min | 0.95 |

**How routing works:**

1. Score all available providers by: cost (35%), quality (30%), speed (20%), availability (15%)
2. Try best provider first
3. On failure, automatically failover to next best provider
4. Continue until success or all providers exhausted

## Messaging Gateway — Permissions, Sending, and Reading Traces Honestly

This section exists because two different ideas get conflated and it causes real confusion. Read it before you let anyone else message your bot.

### 1. Two separate permissions (they are NOT the same thing)

| Permission | Where it lives | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| **Who may trigger the agent** | `gateway.policies.<platform>.allowedUsers` (Agent Hub → Channels → **Permissions**, or `agent-nuvira config gateway allow …`) | Who can *talk to* the bot at all |
| **Who may send to others** | `gateway.policies.<platform>.outboundSenders` (Agent Hub → Permissions → **Send authority**, Contacts page, or `config gateway send-authority …`) | Who can tell the bot to *deliver a message to a third party* |

A third concept, a **contact's approval status**, only gates sending **to** that person — it does not make that person a trusted sender.

**Open by default — know this.** If you never set `outboundSenders`, a platform is **OPEN**: every sender who is allowed to trigger the agent can also direct it to send to anyone. This is the legacy behaviour so nothing silently breaks. To restrict it, set an explicit list:

```bash
# Only YOU may direct the bot to message other people on WhatsApp
agent-nuvira config gateway send-authority add whatsapp +919876543210
# The list is now RESTRICTED to that number. Everyone else is refused.

agent-nuvira config gateway send-authority list whatsapp      # show current state
agent-nuvira config gateway send-authority remove whatsapp +91… # drop one
agent-nuvira config gateway send-authority reset whatsapp      # back to OPEN
agent-nuvira config gateway send-authority require-target whatsapp on  # recipients must be approved contacts
```

Or do the same visually: **Dashboard → Contacts → “🔐 Send authority”** (a platform card per channel, with add/remove, an `open`/`restricted` badge, and “Require approved recipients”), or **Agent Hub → Channels → Permissions → Send authority**.

The list follows the same rules as `allowedUsers`: specific ids restrict it, an empty list means *nobody*, and the `Allow-All` wildcard means *anyone*. A sender can always reply inside their own conversation; send authority only governs messages to **other** targets.

> A CLI/dashboard chat turn (you typing at the keyboard) is trusted and never blocked by this gate — it only applies to remote senders arriving through a messaging platform.

### 2. Who appears where (Contacts vs Agent Hub)

- **Contacts tab** — the directory of people the bot can message. **Telegram** users are auto-registered here on their first message with status **⏳ pending** until you approve them. WhatsApp senders are *not* auto-registered.
- **Agent Hub → Permissions → “Send authority”** — who may command sends to others.
- **Tick `Require approved recipients`** if you want every outbound target to be an approved contact (an explicit `platform:+number` target is otherwise allowed).

### What “pending” means — and what it does not

| Label | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **⏳ pending** | Contacts tab | A real **approval** state — the person messaged the bot and is awaiting your decision |
| **· unsaved** | Agent Hub → Permissions | **Not a state at all** — a local edit you have not saved yet. Reloading the page discards it. Press **💾 Save permissions** before leaving. |

These used to share the word “pending”, which made unsaved edits look like they had vanished. Agent Hub now says **unsaved** so the two can never be confused.

### 3. Reading traces honestly

A trace's `success` flag means **“a reply was generated”** — it does **not** mean an action happened. A model can write `{"tool":"gateway_send", …}` as plain **text** (the loop now recovers that into a real call) or skip tools entirely and simply *say* “I have sent it”.

Every chat trace therefore also carries an **outcome** badge, visible in **Dashboard → Traces**:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 💬 **answered — no action taken** | A text reply only; no tool ran |
| 🔧 **acted — N tool(s)** | One or more tools actually executed |
| ✅ **action performed — message sent** | `gateway_send` ran and reported success |
| ⚠️ **unverified claim** | The answer asserted a delivery that **no tool performed** — treat it as NOT done |
| ❌ / ⏹ | Generation failed / you cancelled the turn |

If a gateway answer claims a send that never happened, the agent now **appends a correction** (“I could not confirm that message was actually sent…”) instead of leaving a false confirmation standing.

**To be sure a message really went out:** look for the ✅ outcome badge on the trace, or a `✅ sent to …` line in the tool result — never trust the model's prose alone.

---

## CLI Commands

### `agent-nuvira models` — Model Discovery (New in v1.1.0)

List available models from any configured provider. Query each provider's model catalog without leaving the terminal.

```bash
# List models from the default provider
agent-nuvira models

# List models from a specific provider
agent-nuvira models --provider nim
agent-nuvira models --provider groq
agent-nuvira models --provider openrouter

# Search for models by keyword
agent-nuvira models --search deepseek
agent-nuvira models --search llama

# Show all providers (even unconfigured ones)
agent-nuvira models --all
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# See all models on Groq
agent-nuvira models --provider groq

# Find DeepSeek models across all configured providers
agent-nuvira models --search deepseek

# Output:
# ════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📋 Available Models (3)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Groq:
# ----------------------------------------
#   deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro [deepseek]
#   deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash [deepseek]
#   deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct [deepseek]
#
# ════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Use a discovered model immediately:

```bash
agent-nuvira chat --provider groq --model deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash
agent-nuvira edit src/server.ts --provider openrouter --model openai/gpt-4o
```

**Model Availability Registry** — the registry is the sub-ms FAISS/JSON store
routing reads on every pick. `models status` shows verified / unavailable /
quota-parked models; `--verbose` adds the two things routing learned from real
usage: which providers are **registry-blocked** (skipped predictively — with the
learned reason for each blocked model) and the **per-action telemetry** (which
action verified/killed which provider × model):

```bash
# Show the registry (verified / unavailable / quota-parked)
agent-nuvira models status

# Same + registry-blocked providers (why routing skips them) + per-action
# "learned from real usage" telemetry (chat/execute/plan/edit verified/killed)
agent-nuvira models status --verbose

# The dashboard's Models panel charts the same feed per action — scrub across
# days (drag / click / range slider / ▶ play) to see each day's exact
# verified vs killed provider × model chips
agent-nuvira dashboard

# Probe + spot-check now (proactive health, not reactive)
agent-nuvira models refresh
# Background maintenance daemon
agent-nuvira models watch

# Escape hatch: manually release a registry-blocked provider (demotes
# unavailable → unverified, clears quota parks + ledger cooldown, then
# re-probes the live API to re-learn the truth — honest stillBlocked output)
agent-nuvira models unblock gemini
# Same, but skip the live re-probe (demote + un-park only)
agent-nuvira models unblock nim --no-spot-check
# Machine-readable for CI
agent-nuvira models unblock groq --json
```

---

### `agent-nuvira chat` — Interactive Chat

Start a terminal-based chat session with any provider.

```bash
# Interactive mode (default provider)
agent-nuvira chat

# One-shot prompt
agent-nuvira chat "what is the difference between TCP and UDP?"

# Specify provider and model
agent-nuvira chat --provider gemini --model gemini-2.0-flash-exp

# Include a file as context
agent-nuvira chat --file ./src/main.ts "explain this code"

# Disable caching
agent-nuvira chat --no-cache
```

**Interactive commands** within a chat session:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/exit` or `/quit` | End the session |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/info` | Show current provider details |
| `/help` | Show available commands |

---

### `agent-nuvira edit` — AI-Assisted File Editing

Edit a file using natural language instructions. The AI reads the file, applies your instruction, and writes the result back.

```bash
# Edit with default instruction ("Review and improve this code")
agent-nuvira edit src/server.ts

# Provide a specific instruction
agent-nuvira edit src/server.ts --instruction "add rate limiting middleware"

# Use a specific provider
agent-nuvira edit src/server.ts --provider openrouter --model openai/gpt-4o

# Preview changes without modifying the file
agent-nuvira edit src/server.ts --instruction "add error handling" --dry-run
```

---

### `agent-nuvira plan` — Implementation Plans

Analyze a directory or file and generate a structured implementation plan.

```bash
# Plan for the current directory
agent-nuvira plan

# Plan for a specific target with a task description
agent-nuvira plan ./src --task "add user authentication with JWT"

# Use a cloud provider for complex planning
agent-nuvira plan . --task "refactor to microservices" --provider gemini

# Verbose mode shows the full context sent to the model
agent-nuvira plan -v
```

The plan includes:
1. **Summary** — high-level overview
2. **Files to Modify** — specific files and changes
3. **Architecture Changes** — structural modifications
4. **Implementation Steps** — ordered guide
5. **Potential Risks** — edge cases and breaking changes
6. **Testing Strategy** — verification approach

---

### `agent-nuvira config` — Configuration Management

```bash
# Show full config
agent-nuvira config

# Set a value
agent-nuvira config set defaultProvider openrouter

# Get a specific value
agent-nuvira config get providers.nim.model

# List all providers with their status
agent-nuvira config list

# Initialize (show defaults)
agent-nuvira config init
```

---

### `agent-nuvira cache` — Cache Management

Inference responses are cached in a local SQLite database (`~/.nuvira/cache.db`) with a default TTL of 1 hour.

```bash
# Show cache statistics
agent-nuvira cache stats

# Clear all cached responses
agent-nuvira cache clear
```

---

### `agent-nuvira model` — Context-Preserving Model Switching

Switch inference providers and models on the fly without losing conversation history, agent state, or session continuity. The active model persists across CLI restarts.

```bash
# Show current active model + prompt to switch
agent-nuvira model

# List all providers with their status
agent-nuvira model list

# Interactive categorized model picker
# (choose "Browse by provider" to drill into ONE provider's full model list,
#  e.g. OpenRouter's 100+ models, and pick a specific one)
agent-nuvira model switch

# Switch to a provider with its default model
agent-nuvira model switch groq

# Switch to a specific provider/model pair
agent-nuvira model switch groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile

# Auto routing — agent decides the best provider/model per task
# (fast cheap models for simple work, stronger models for complex tasks,
#  local models for private tasks)
agent-nuvira model switch auto

# Show detailed active configuration
agent-nuvira model info

# Get model routing recommendations
agent-nuvira model recommend

# Explain why Auto routing picks a model for a task (transparency/debugging)
agent-nuvira model explain "implement JWT auth with refresh tokens"
agent-nuvira model explain                  # walks 5 sample complexities
agent-nuvira model explain --agent writer "your task"
agent-nuvira model explain "your task" --json  # machine-readable (scripting/CI)

# Walk through a narrated decision (the 🎯 fit / 📏 measured / ⏳ ctx chips)
# → see MODELS_EXPLAIN_DEMO.md for a full annotated example

# Benchmark the exact provider/model pairs the Auto router picks
agent-nuvira benchmark --routing

# Evaluate the Auto router's picks end-to-end (full multi-agent pipeline + hidden tests)
agent-nuvira eval --routing

# Every explain snapshot + routing-mode pick is recorded to the dashboard's audit trail
# (Routing panel → 'Audit Trail — routing decision timeline')

# Quick health check for the active provider
agent-nuvira model health
```

**Priority chain:** CLI `--provider`/`--model` flags → `agent-nuvira model switch` active state → default config file — the most specific wins.

#### Learning Router — Thompson-sampling bandit + hard constraints (v1.51.0 Enhanced)

Auto routing can **learn from real outcomes** (ruflo-inspired `model-router` math, generalized to all providers). The routing engine scores providers across 5 weighted dimensions (reasoning, speed, cost, privacy, reliability) with per-complexity weight matrices for all 5 levels.

```bash
# Enable bandit learning — each provider's score is multiplied by a Beta draw
# learned per complexity bucket from actual task successes/failures
agent-nuvira config set routing.bandit true

# Hard per-call budget (USD) — providers whose typical call exceeds this are
# eliminated, not just scored lower
agent-nuvira config set routing.maxCostUsd 0.005

# Minimum capability floors for auto-routed tasks (0–1)
agent-nuvira config set routing.minSpeed 0.5
agent-nuvira config set routing.minReasoning 0.6
```

#### How the routing engine works (v1.51.0)

**5 scoring dimensions:** Every provider has a static capability profile (0–1) for reasoning, speed, cost, privacy, reliability. The cost dimension is computed from **real per-1K-token pricing** (free tiers = $0) — configurable via `agent-nuvira config set pricing.<provider>.inputPer1K`.

**5 complexity levels:** The task description is analyzed for keywords to determine complexity (trivial → critical). Each level has a distinct weight matrix that shifts dominance:
- **Trivial/simple:** cost + speed dominate (fast small model)
- **Moderate:** balanced
- **Complex/critical:** reasoning + reliability dominate (deep reasoning with larger model)

**4 preference modes:** `balanced`, `performance-first`, `cost-first`, `privacy-first` — each applies additive weight adjustments that shift the routing decision predictably.

**1. Thompson-sampling bandit** — Each provider keeps a **Beta(α, β) prior per complexity bucket** so learning is task-type-local. Final score = `deterministicScore × θ` where `θ ~ Beta(α, β)`. Cold start `Beta(1,1)` behaves like the plain heuristic router until outcomes accumulate. The orchestrator **records every auto-routed task's outcome** (success/failure) into the bandit. Success rewards are **cost-adjusted** — a cheap provider's success is worth the most. State persists to `~/.nuvira/memory/router-bandit.json`.

**2. Uncertainty-driven escalation** — When the bandit's winner has no learned data (α+β < default 8 samples), routing escalates to the next-ranked provider that HAS learned data with a ≥55% win-rate floor. This prevents a cold-start winner from committing to a coin flip.

**3. Per-modelId learning** — Both provider-level and model-level Beta priors track which concrete model won (e.g., `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` ≠ `openai/gpt-oss-20b` on the same provider). Cold start keeps the configured pin; learned models prefer the best Thompson-sampled one.

**4. Promotion gate A/B** — Every auto-routed task records both the deterministic heuristic pick and the bandit pick for the same task. The `agent-nuvira model bandit` command evaluates 3 criteria (quality improvement >2%, cost regression ≤1%, p95 latency regression ≤5%) before promoting the bandit over the heuristic.

**5. Routing rules** — Regex/string task-pattern rules force a specific provider/model before scoring (first match wins). Rules also note the forced provider for correct bandit outcome attribution.

**6. Hard constraints** — `routing.maxCostUsd`, `routing.minSpeed`, `routing.minReasoning` eliminate violating providers with graceful fallback when constraints would remove everything.

**7. Credential-aware filtering** — Auto routing never picks a provider without configured credentials. The ModelRegistry fast path verifies usable models; explicit `allowedProviders` always win.

**8. Quota-ledger integration** — Exhausted providers sink below healthy ones like circuit-breaker cooldown, only picked when every candidate is parked.

**9. Runtime stats blending** — Benchmark quality scores (30%) + per-agent best-model stats adjust provider capability scores in real time.

**10. Verification-aware escalation** — Verification-heavy tasks (deploy, security audit) boost reasoning+reliability weights and reorder candidates so the strongest provider for verification is tried first.

**11. Free/local-first gate** — `routing.allowPaid: false` keeps paid providers out of trivial/simple/moderate tasks; complex/critical tasks may still use high-capacity models.

Inspect and manage the bandit from the CLI:

```bash
# Show the bandit state (α/β priors + expected win % per provider × complexity bucket)
agent-nuvira model bandit

# Machine-readable snapshot (priors, expected win rates, learning history)
agent-nuvira model bandit --json

# Reset all Beta priors back to Beta(1,1)
agent-nuvira model bandit reset
```

The dashboard's 🤖 **Routing** panel shows the same bandit live — an α/β heatmap plus a learning-history timeline (enable `routing.bandit` and run auto-routed tasks to populate it). It also renders a live **🎖️ Promotion Gate** card: an A/B verdict on whether the bandit is actually **better than the deterministic heuristic**, judged on real trajectories (`router-promotion.jsonl`) — quality must improve >2% while cost and latency don't regress.

**Routing rules** — force a specific provider/model for task patterns (regex/string, evaluated before scoring, first match wins):

```jsonc
// ~/.nuvira/nuvirarc.json
{
  "routing": {
    "bandit": true,
    "maxCostUsd": 0.005,
    "rules": [
      { "name": "marketing → groq", "pattern": "email|sales|copy", "provider": "groq" },
      { "name": "refactor → local", "pattern": "refactor", "provider": "local" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Every decision records a `routedBy` source (`heuristic` | `rule` | `bandit`) in the dashboard's routing audit trail so you can see exactly how each pick was produced. The `routedBy` field is also exposed in the `AutoRouteResult` for programmatic access.

#### Auto-mode session failover — providers that die mid-session get swapped automatically

A provider can look healthy at pick time and still fail mid-session: Gemini's
`token limit exceeded`, OpenRouter 401s, quota exhaustion, or a rate limit on a
free tier. In Auto mode, `chat` now **remembers failed providers for the session**
and routes around them instead of getting stuck:

| Failure kind | Handling |
|---|---|
| **Auth** (expired/invalid key, 401) | Provider excluded from Auto routing for the **whole session** — re-picked routes skip it entirely |
| **Rate limit** (429, quota exceeded, `token limit`, `insufficient_quota`, `resource has been exhausted`) | Provider parked for a **120s cooldown** (aligned with the circuit breaker), then automatically re-admitted |
| **5xx / network** | Flows through the shared **circuit breaker** (3 failures in 60s → 120s cooldown); never session-excluded |

On failure the chat loop prints `⚠️ <provider> failed — automatically switching to
<provider> (<model>)` and transparently re-routes to the next-best candidate.
In-cooldown providers are deprioritized by router scoring (via circuit-breaker
state), the final fallback always prefers a provider that hasn't failed this
session, and the failover path is crash-proof — a throwing re-route can't kill
the interactive loop. Works for both streaming and non-streaming responses.

#### Deterministic Tier-0 routing — mechanical edits without an LLM

Simple mechanical edits never touch an LLM (ruflo's `enhanced-model-router` Tier-1 codemod idea, built on agent-nuvira's editing engine):

| Goal pattern | Deterministic transform | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `remove all console.log statements` / `clean up debug logging` | Strips standalone `console.*` lines | **$0 · <1ms** |
| `rename foo to bar` (symbol present in context) | Word-boundary rename across all references | **$0 · <1ms** |
| `remove duplicate imports` | Deduplicates same-module import lines | **$0 · <1ms** |

- Runs **before** the LLM in the edit pipeline; every transformed file is **AST-validated** first, so tier-0 never emits broken code.
- If the goal isn't mechanical (or validation fails), the pipeline **falls through to the LLM** unchanged.
- Tier-0 results flow through the same safe-apply pipeline (dry-run, sandbox, review bundles) and emit `edit:written` events tagged `via: tier0`.
- Disable per call with `useTier0: false` in the EditModule API.

#### Central quota ledger — free/local-first routing with reset windows

Every Auto-routed call is write-through recorded into a **central quota ledger** (tokens/requests per provider × model). The ledger powers four things:

1. **Calendar-aware reset windows** — daily/hourly free-tier limits with automatic re-enable exactly when the window rolls (no arbitrary timers).
2. **Predictive parking** — a provider that exhausts its window is **parked** and sinks below healthy candidates **before** the next call, not after a reactive failure.
3. **Free/local-first gate** — `routing.allowPaid: false` keeps paid providers out of trivial/simple/moderate tasks; complex/critical tasks may still use paid high-capacity models.
4. **Cost transparency** — `agent-nuvira model quota` shows free vs paid tokens and an **estimated $ saved** figure (what the free-tier usage would have cost at a typical paid rate).

```bash
# Set per-provider quota limits (requests per reset window)
agent-nuvira config set routing.quota.gemini.requestsPerWindow 1500
agent-nuvira config set routing.quota.groq.requestsPerWindow 14400
agent-nuvira config set routing.quota.groq.tokensPerWindow 1000000
agent-nuvira config set routing.quota.groq.windowMs 86400000   # 24h reset window

# Free/local-only unless complexity demands paid (assessment-gap gate)
agent-nuvira config set routing.allowPaid false

# Inspect the ledger (tokens/requests per provider × model, resets in, parked state)
# and the cost summary (free vs paid tokens + estimated $ saved)
agent-nuvira model quota

# Same data machine-readable (costSummary field) for scripting/CI
agent-nuvira model quota --json

# Clear all ledger entries
agent-nuvira model quota reset
```

The dashboard's 📒 **Quota Ledger** card shows the same data live — per-entry status plus a free/local-first cost split (free tokens = savings, paid tokens = actual spend) with an estimated $ saved badge.

**Failover timeline (transparency: when failover occurred).** Every park, window-reset re-enable, manual release, and mid-session failover is appended to `~/.nuvira/memory/quota-events.jsonl` (capped at 200). The dashboard's Quota card renders it as a **Failover Timeline**, and `agent-nuvira model quota` prints the last 20 events:

```bash
agent-nuvira model quota
#   ── Failover Timeline (last 20) ──
#    ⚡ failover    gemini        (rate-limit)  8/2/2026, 5:10:02 PM
#    ⏸ parked      gemini        (rate-limit)  8/2/2026, 5:10:02 PM
#    🔁 re-enabled  groq          (window reset) 8/2/2026, 5:09:00 PM
```

The timeline is also **live**: the dashboard watches `quota-events.jsonl` /
`quota-ledger.json` on disk and pushes a `quota` SSE event the moment a failover
or park lands — so the card updates in real time, no page refresh or 10s wait.
(The watcher arms while a dashboard is connected and disarms when the last one
disconnects.) To keep it armed from server start — so the timeline is already
current the moment a dashboard connects, even after the server sat idle between
viewing sessions — enable always-on mode:

```bash
# Keep the quota watcher armed from server start (never disarms on client count)
agent-nuvira config set routing.alwaysWatchQuota true
```

Always-on trades a tiny idle fs watch for instant-up-to-date quota state.

#### Vector retrieval — token-efficient context (saves tokens, complements the quota ledger)

Agent-Nuvira can **vectorize large context** with a local embedding model + the
pure-JS vector store — no FAISS/native deps, no server. The retrieval layer
saves tokens (stretching free quotas), while the quota ledger manages limits:

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Chunking** | Large files split into ~512-token chunks (64-token overlap, paragraph-aware) |
| **Embedding** | `bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim) via @huggingface/transformers — local, free, offline, cached |
| **Vector store** | Pure-JS cosine-similarity index in `~/.nuvira/memory/vectors-repo.json` (honors `BUFF_MEMORY_DIR`), isolated from memory/history vectors |
| **Retrieval** | Goal/subtask embedded → top-k chunks (default 5) → reduced context |
| **Router policy** | Context ≤ threshold (12k tokens) → **direct call, zero overhead**; larger → embed + retrieve; any failure → **failover to full context** (never breaks the LLM call) |
| **Transparency** | `🧠 Retrieved 5 chunks — reduced context 20k → 3k tokens` + `agent-nuvira retrieval stats` + dashboard Retrieval card |

```bash
# Pre-index a repo so Auto runs are instant (first run downloads the ~130MB
# model once, then cached locally)
agent-nuvira retrieval index .

# Semantic search over the indexed repo
agent-nuvira retrieval query "how does login with JWT work?"

# Token-savings transparency
agent-nuvira retrieval stats

# Wipe index + stats
agent-nuvira retrieval clear
```

Where retrieval applies (honest split):
- **`agent-nuvira chat --file <large-file>`** — the file is chunked, embedded, and
  reduced to the top-k relevant chunks before the LLM call (big token savings).
- **`agent-nuvira execute` pipelines** — after the context-gatherer collects files, the
  orchestrator indexes them and produces a **semantic file ranking** for the
  writer (relevance over size when selecting which files fit the token budget),
  and records the retrieval into the token-savings stats.

**Config** (`routing.retrieval`):

```bash
# Master switch (default true)
agent-nuvira config set routing.retrieval.enabled false

# Top-k chunks (default 5), chunk size (default 512 tokens), vectorize threshold (default 12000 tokens)
agent-nuvira config set routing.retrieval.topK 8
agent-nuvira config set routing.retrieval.chunkTokens 640
agent-nuvira config set routing.retrieval.thresholdTokens 20000
```

**Vector search backend** (`memory.vectorBackend`):

```bash
# Show which backend is active
agent-nuvira memory stats        # ... Backend: faiss-ivf (FAISS-style IVF-flat ANN)

# Choose the backend explicitly
agent-nuvira config set memory.vectorBackend auto   # default: native FAISS when built, else pure-JS IVF
agent-nuvira config set memory.vectorBackend faiss  # prefer FAISS-style; JSON fallback on native failure
agent-nuvira config set memory.vectorBackend json   # exact flat cosine (the original behavior)
```

- **`auto` (default)** — uses the **FAISS-style backend**: real `@faiss-node/native`
  bindings when the user has installed AND built them (smoke-tested at load),
  otherwise a **pure-JS IVF-flat ANN** — a faithful TypeScript port of FAISS's
  `IndexIVFFlat` (nlist inverted lists via deterministic k-means++, nprobe
  probe lists, cosine = inner product of L2-normalized vectors). Small indexes
  (≤ 512 entries) use an EXACT scan so results are identical to the JSON
  backend; large indexes get sub-linear approximate search with filter-aware
  probe expansion. Any native failure falls back gracefully — semantic search
  never breaks.
- **Why native FAISS is not the hard default (decision):** `@faiss-node/native`
  ships no prebuilt binaries and requires compiling FAISS from source
  (cmake + OpenBLAS + libomp) at install time — verified to fail on a stock
  macOS dev box. Making it a required dependency would break zero-setup
  `npx agent-nuvira`. The pure-JS IVF-flat backend provides the same
  FAISS-style approximate-NN behavior with zero native deps; users who build
  the native package automatically get the real thing.

**Roadmap (Step 6 — future enhancements):**
1. **Hybrid retrieval** — combine embeddings with keyword/BM25 scoring for
   exact-match-sensitive queries.
2. **Embedding caching** — the embedder already caches in-memory; a persistent
   on-disk embedding cache would skip re-embedding unchanged chunks across
   sessions.
3. **Multi-vector routing** — different embedding models for code vs natural
   language (the store already supports namespaced indexes, so this is a
   config-level addition).

**Opt-in failover confirmation.** By default Auto mode fails over silently
(never get stuck). If you'd rather approve each mid-session swap, enable:

```bash
# Ask before Auto mode switches providers mid-session
agent-nuvira config set routing.promptOnFailover true
```

With this on, a failed provider shows the next-ranked candidate and lets you
choose "switch (recommended)" or "pick a provider myself" — so every swap is
an informed decision, not a silent surprise.

This also applies to **single-shot Auto prompts** (`agent-nuvira chat "ask something"`
with `-m auto`): before Auto mode silently hops to the next candidate, the CLI
asks; picking "manual" surfaces the original provider error instead of
switching behind your back.

#### Checkpoint / resume — crash-proof multi-agent pipelines

Long `agent-nuvira execute` pipelines can be killed by a crash, quota exhaustion, or a token expiry mid-run. Checkpoints serialize the pipeline state so work is never lost:

```bash
# Save a resume-able checkpoint after every task batch (in ~/.nuvira/memory/checkpoints/)
agent-nuvira execute "build the API" --checkpoint

# Resume the latest checkpoint for this goal + cwd (skips completed steps + the planner)
agent-nuvira execute "build the API" --resume

# Resume a specific checkpoint
agent-nuvira execute "build the API" --resume cp-3f9a2c1d0b7e

# List saved checkpoints (goal, progress %, saved-at)
agent-nuvira execute --checkpoint-list
```

How it works:
- After **every task batch** the orchestrator saves a snapshot of the task plan (per-step statuses), artifacts, file changes, and metadata.
- `--resume` rehydrates the vault, **skips completed steps and the planner**, and continues from the first pending step — on whatever provider/model is now available.
- `--checkpoint` alone always starts **fresh** (it never silently resumes a stale checkpoint); only an explicit `--resume` loads.
- State persists across sessions, so a provider that died mid-pipeline can resume on the next-best provider with zero rework (assessment item #6: continuity across models).

### `agent-nuvira execute --auto-branch` — Branch Automation

Automate your entire git workflow with trigger-based hooks. Install once, then let the agent handle branch creation, commits, and PR updates automatically.

```bash
# Step 1: Install branch automation hooks
agent-nuvira execute "install branch hooks" --auto-branch

# Step 2: Check automation status
agent-nuvira execute "check branch status" --auto-branch

# Step 3: Auto-create a branch from an issue
agent-nuvira execute "auto-create branch from issue PROJ-123" --auto-branch

# Step 4: Auto-commit changes with a conventional message
agent-nuvira execute "auto-commit changes" --auto-branch

# Step 5: Start file-watch mode (auto-commits on file changes)
agent-nuvira execute "start file watch" --auto-branch

# Step 6: Diagnose CI failures
agent-nuvira execute "check CI for PR #42" --auto-branch
```

**Trigger Sources:**

| Trigger | Action | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Issue → Branch** | `feat/PROJ-123-description` | Auto-creates branches with conventional naming when issues are assigned |
| **PR Label → Update** | `git push origin <branch>` | Commits and pushes changes when labels like `wip` or `needs-work` are detected |
| **File Watch → Commit** | `git commit -m "feat(scope): ..."` | Background polling detects file changes and auto-commits with conventional messages |
| **CI Status → Fix** | LLM diagnosis + fix plan | Analyzes CI failures from recent commits and suggests targeted fixes |

**Conventional Commit Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, perf
Scope: module/area affected (auto-detected from changed files)
```

**Installed Hooks:**

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `post-checkout` | Detects issue-based branches on checkout and loads context |
| `pre-commit` | Enforces conventional commit format with auto-detection |
| `file-watch.sh` | Background script that polls for changes and triggers auto-commits |

### `agent-nuvira skill` — Skill Compiler System

Automatically convert successful agent execution trajectories into reusable, parameterized skill scripts. Skills are extracted by an LLM from high-scoring runs, saved to `~/.nuvira/skills/`, and invoked directly via the orchestrator.

```bash
# List all compiled skills
agent-nuvira skill list

# Show a skill's definition and steps
agent-nuvira skill show "Add CLI Command"

# Run a skill with parameters (invokes the orchestrator)
agent-nuvira skill run "Add CLI Command" --params commandName=deploy --params description="Deploy to production"

# Manually trigger skill compilation from recent trajectories
agent-nuvira skill compile

# Search skills by keyword
agent-nuvira skill search "cli"

# Show skill quality scores
agent-nuvira skill quality

# Garbage-collect old/low-quality skills
agent-nuvira skill gc
```

**How it works:** Every 8 successful orchestration runs, the Self-Improver automatically feeds the top-5 trajectories to the Skill Compiler. The LLM identifies reusable patterns and parameterizes them with `{{paramName}}` placeholders. Skills act as pre-built task plans that the orchestrator can execute on demand.

---

### `agent-nuvira skills` — Community Skills Marketplace

Search, install, update, and manage community skills from the multi-source registry. Distinct from `agent-nuvira skill` (singular), which manages internal trajectory-compiled skills.

```bash
# Search the registry for skills matching a query
agent-nuvira skills search "deploy"
agent-nuvira skills search "security audit"

# Install a skill from the registry (into <project>/.agents/skills/)
agent-nuvira skills install code-assessment
agent-nuvira skills install website-deploy

# Install from a specific source kind
agent-nuvira skills install my-skill --source git-repo
agent-nuvira skills install my-skill --source local-dir

# List installed skills with provenance
agent-nuvira skills list
agent-nuvira skills list --origin registry
agent-nuvira skills list --origin local

# Update installed skills to newer versions
agent-nuvira skills update

# Uninstall a skill
agent-nuvira skills uninstall code-assessment

# Create a cross-skill bundle (Hermes parity)
agent-nuvira skills bundle backend-dev --create --name "Backend Dev" --description "Full workflow" --skills code-assessment,test-strategy

# List bundles
agent-nuvira skills bundle --list

# Show bundle contents
agent-nuvira skills bundle backend-dev --show
```

### Skill Execution — Language-Agnostic Marketplace Skills

Execute skills from the marketplace in any language (Python, Node.js, Shell, TypeScript) without the agent needing to understand the language.

```bash
# Execute a Python skill (e.g., image generation)
agent-nuvira skill execute image-gen --prompt "A sunset over mountains"

# Execute a Node.js skill (e.g., API call)
agent-nuvira skill execute api-call --endpoint /users --method GET

# Execute a Shell skill (e.g., system check)
agent-nuvira skill execute system-check --check disk

# The skill tool also supports execution via the agent
# Agent calls: skill tool → execute: { skill: "image-gen", args: { prompt: "..." } }
```

**How it works:**
1. Skill declares `runtime: python` (or node/shell/auto) in frontmatter
2. Executor auto-detects language from frontmatter, file extension, or shebang
3. API keys are injected via environment variables (provider credentials blocked for security)
4. Script is executed in a subprocess with timeout and output capture
5. Returns structured result (stdout, stderr, exit code, duration)

**Security:** Provider credentials (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are automatically blocked from skill execution. Only skill-declared `required_environment_variables` are injected.

# Set your API key
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."

# List available models (Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, DeepSeek, and more)
agent-nuvira models --provider groq

# Chat with any model
agent-nuvira chat --provider groq --model llama-3.3-70b-versatile
agent-nuvira chat --provider groq --model deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash

# Edit with Groq's fast inference
agent-nuvira edit src/server.ts --provider groq --model llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

The Groq adapter uses `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` by default.

**Get a free API key:** [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### NVIDIA NIM

Connects to the **NVIDIA NIM** OpenAI-compatible API at `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`.

```bash
# Set your API key
export NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY="nvapi-..."

# List available models (121 models)
agent-nuvira models --provider nim

# Chat with any model
agent-nuvira chat --provider nim --model meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
agent-nuvira chat --provider nim --model deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash
```

The NIM adapter uses `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` by default. You can override the base URL for self-hosted NIM deployments:

```bash
agent-nuvira config set providers.nim.baseUrl "http://your-nim-host:8000/v1"
```

### Google Gemini

Connects to the **Google Gemini API** free tier.

```bash
# Set your API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."

# Use it (supports 8K+ token context)
agent-nuvira chat --provider gemini --model gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

### OpenRouter

Routes through **OpenRouter** for access to 200+ models from multiple providers.

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."

# List available models
agent-nuvira models --provider openrouter

# Use a specific model
agent-nuvira chat --provider openrouter --model openai/gpt-4o
agent-nuvira chat --provider openrouter --model anthropic/claude-3-haiku
```

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration (`agent-nuvira execute`)

The `execute` command runs an autonomous multi-agent pipeline that can plan, gather context, write code, review changes, run tests, and publish — all from a single goal.

```bash
# Execute a multi-agent pipeline
agent-nuvira execute "add JWT authentication to the Express app"

# With verbose logging to see each agent's work
agent-nuvira execute "add a health check endpoint" --verbose

# Use a specific provider for all agents
agent-nuvira execute "refactor the database layer" --provider groq

# Dry-run mode (shows what would change without writing)
agent-nuvira execute "add rate limiting" --dry-run

# Configure models per agent type
agent-nuvira execute "add tests" --agent-model planner=gemini --agent-model writer=groq

# Use persistent memory across sessions
agent-nuvira execute "fix the login bug" --memory

# Set a custom context window limit (default: 128,000 tokens)
agent-nuvira execute "refactor large codebase" --context-limit 256000

# Adjust pruning aggressiveness for long chains
agent-nuvira execute "build entire microservice" --context-prune medium
agent-nuvira execute "migrate database schema" --context-prune aggressive
```

**Context pruning flags:**

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--context-limit <tokens>` | Max tokens before automatic pruning activates | 128000 |
| `--context-prune <mode>` | Prune aggressiveness: `soft` \| `medium` \| `aggressive` | `soft` |

The pruner automatically compresses the shared agent context between pipeline steps using 5 strategies: metadata stripping, file change collapsing, conversation truncation, artifact summarization, and aggressive fallback.


The pipeline runs these agents in dependency-aware order with parallelization:

| # | Agent | Type | Description |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Planner** | Core | Analyzes the goal, creates a dependency-aware task plan |
| 2 | **Context Gatherer** | Core | Scans the codebase for relevant files and artifacts |
| 3 | **Security Scanner** | Safety | Scans for PII, prompt injection, and dangerous patterns |
| 4 | **Writer** | Core | Implements the code changes based on plan and context |
| 5 | **Reviewer** | Quality | Validates changes for bugs, security, and code style |
| 6 | **Tester** | Testing | Runs tests in a sandboxed temp directory or Docker container |
| 7 | **Debugger** | Testing | Iteratively diagnoses and fixes test failures via LLM |
| 8 | **Runner** | Execution | Executes shell commands to verify the program works |
| 9 | **MCP Agent** | Integration | Invokes external tools from connected MCP servers |
| 10 | **Skill Runner** | Learning | Executes compiled skill scripts as pre-built task plans |
| 11 | **Git Agent** | Publishing | Creates branches, commits with LLM-generated messages |
| 12 | **PR Description** | Publishing | Generates PR descriptions from git diff via LLM |
| 13 | **Package Agent** | Publishing | Bumps versions, builds, publishes to npm |
| 14 | **GitHub Release** | Publishing | Creates tags, release notes, and GitHub releases |

**Parallel execution:** Independent agents (e.g., Reviewer + Tester) run concurrently via `Promise.all()`. Exclusive agents (Runner, Debugger) get dedicated access. Results are merged with conflict resolution.

**Interactive development mode:** `agent-nuvira execute` without a goal launches an interactive loop with:
- **Model picker** — Choose your provider/model interactively
- **Session tracking** — Full history of goals executed in the session
- **Failure analysis** — Per-agent-type diagnosis with recovery actions
- **Follow-up suggestions** — LLM-powered contextual next steps
- **/fix** — Retry the last failed goal with failure context
- **/save / /resume** — Save and restore sessions across restarts
- **/suggest** — Search past trajectories for similar goals

## Workflow Examples

### Discover and Chat with a Model

```bash
# Step 1: See what's available on Groq
agent-nuvira models --provider groq

# Step 2: Narrow down by keyword
agent-nuvira models --search deepseek

# Step 3: Chat with a found model
agent-nuvira chat --provider groq --model deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash
```

### Hybrid Provider Usage

Use different providers for different tasks:

```bash
# Use local models for quick, small edits
agent-nuvira edit README.md --instruction "fix typos" --provider local

# Use Groq for fast code generation
agent-nuvira edit src/routes.ts --instruction "add validation" --provider groq

# Use cloud models for complex planning
agent-nuvira plan . --task "design the database schema" --provider gemini

# Use OpenRouter for diverse model selection
agent-nuvira chat --provider openrouter --model openai/gpt-4o
```

### Multi-Agent Pipeline

```bash
# Let the multi-agent system handle everything
agent-nuvira execute "add input validation for all API routes"

# With verbose logging to see each step
agent-nuvira execute "create a health check endpoint" --verbose

# Use Groq for fast agent execution
agent-nuvira execute "refactor login logic" --provider groq
```

---

## Plugin System: Adding a New Provider

The plugin system allows you to add custom inference providers without modifying the CLI's core code.

### Step 1: Implement `InferenceProvider`

Create a class that implements the `InferenceProvider` interface:

```typescript
import { InferenceProvider } from 'agent-nuvira';
import { InferenceOptions, ProviderConfig } from 'agent-nuvira';

export class AnthropicAdapter implements InferenceProvider {
  readonly name = 'Anthropic';
  private config: ProviderConfig;

  constructor(config: ProviderConfig) {
    this.config = config;
  }

  async generate(prompt: string, options?: InferenceOptions): Promise<string> {
    const apiKey = this.config.apiKey;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error('Anthropic API key not configured');
    }

    const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': apiKey,
        'anthropic-version': '2023-06-01',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: options?.model || 'claude-3-haiku-20240307',
        max_tokens: options?.maxTokens || 1024,
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    return data.content[0].text;
  }

  async isAvailable(): Promise<boolean> {
    return !!this.config.apiKey;
  }

  getInfo(): string {
    return `Provider: Anthropic Claude\nModel: ${this.config.model || 'default'}\nStatus: ${this.config.apiKey ? '✅' : '❌'}`;
  }

  async listModels(): Promise<Array<{ id: string; name: string; provider: string; owner?: string; description?: string }>> {
    if (!this.config.apiKey) return [];
    // Fetch models from Anthropic API
    return [{ id: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', name: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', provider: 'Anthropic' }];
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Plugin Wrapper

```typescript
import { ProviderPlugin, ProviderConfig, PluginMetadata } from 'agent-nuvira';
import { AnthropicAdapter } from './anthropic-adapter';

export const AnthropicPlugin: ProviderPlugin = {
  metadata: {
    name: 'Anthropic Claude',
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: 'Anthropic Claude API integration',
    author: 'You',
  },

  getProviderType(): string {
    return 'anthropic';
  },

  createProvider(config: ProviderConfig): AnthropicAdapter {
    return new AnthropicAdapter(config);
  },
};
```

### Step 3: Register the Plugin

At your application's entry point:

```typescript
import { getPluginRegistry } from 'agent-nuvira';
import { AnthropicPlugin } from './anthropic-plugin';

const registry = getPluginRegistry();
registry.register(AnthropicPlugin);
```

### Step 4: Configure and Use

Add the provider to your `nuvirarc.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "anthropic",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
      "model": "claude-3-haiku-20240307",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 4096
    }
  }
}
```

Then use it:

```bash
agent-nuvira chat --provider anthropic
```

> **Note:** Plugins placed in `~/.nuvira/plugins/` are **auto-discovered** at CLI startup — no manual registration required. Programmatic registration via the Plugin Registry API is also supported for advanced use cases.

| **v1.49.0** | Aug 2026 | Hermetic memory tests, IVF-vs-exact recall/latency benchmark, cross-session backend transparency |
| **v1.49.1** | Aug 2026 | Native FAISS tier actually activates — rewritten for the real `@faiss-node/native` v0.1.11 API; `agent-nuvira memory backend --check` |
| **v1.50.0** | Aug 2026 | `agent-nuvira memory backend --check` diagnostics — active backend, why it was chosen, native-FAISS availability probe + install guidance |
| **v1.51.0** | Aug 2026 | Routing strategy super-enhancement — Thompson-sampling bandit, uncertainty escalation, per-model learning, promotion gate A/B, routing rules, hard constraints, credential-aware filtering, quota-ledger integration, runtime stats blending, verification escalation, free/local-first gate; 2,934 tests |
| **v1.51.1** | Aug 2026 | Docs patch — completed the published README version-history table (added v1.50.0 + v1.51.0 rows) |
| **v1.52.0** | Aug 2026 | Predictive model-availability routing (registry drives every pick — dead/unkeyed providers skipped before scoring, no more wasted first calls); web dashboard: scrubbable pipeline phase timeline + narrated "why did the router pick this?" walkthrough; 2,990 tests |
| **v1.53.0** | Aug 2026 | Per-action "learned from real usage" telemetry everywhere (chat/execute/plan/edit/skill/learn/ci/doctor all write the registry; dashboard panel + `models status --verbose` show who killed/verified what); daily timeline chart in the dashboard; recovery loop (a later real success un-parks + re-verifies a recovered provider); hermetic E2E failover test (`tests/e2e/`) proving "registry learns the block, next pick skips it"; 2,996 tests |
| **v1.54.0** | Aug 2026 | VS Code extension telemetry attribution — the extension tags every IDE-driven LLM call with `BUFF_TELEMETRY_ACTION` (`ide-chat` / `ide-inline` / `ide-<command>`) so IDE usage gets its own rows in the per-action "learned from real usage" registry log + dashboard panel; 3,002 tests |
| **v1.55.0** | Aug 2026 | `agent-nuvira models unblock <provider>` escape hatch — manually release a registry-blocked provider (demote unavailable→unverified, clear quota parks + ledger cooldown, live re-probe with honest `stillBlocked`); also fixed the pre-existing `models status --json` / `refresh --json` flag-shadowing bug; 3,011 tests |
| **v1.60.0** | Aug 2026 | **No hardcoded model defaults — fully dynamic selection** — `defaultProvider` is now `'auto'`, resolved at runtime to the best *available* provider for your keys + learned registry (verified → configured-with-key → zero-config local); every provider's model pin is the `'default'` sentinel, resolved at call time to a registry-verified working model (explicit pins still win, health-checked). New `src/learning/model-selection.ts` is the single selection authority (`rankAvailableProviders` / `resolveDefaultProvider` / `requireAdapterModel`); fallback chains are built from what you actually configured — never a fixed list; `'auto'` can never reach an adapter factory (onboarding guidance instead); 3,395 tests |
| **v1.60.1** | Aug 2026 | **Live per-model context windows feed the router's context preflight** — the model probe records each provider-advertised context window into the Model Availability Registry (Ollama `/api/tags` `general.context_length`, OpenRouter `/models` `context_length`); `resolveContextWindow` precedence: user override → **live registry descriptor** → provider-level estimate → generous default; `ModelDescriptor`/`ModelRegistryEntry` gain `contextWindowTokens`; 3,398 tests |
| **v1.60.2** | Aug 2026 | **Live context windows for every provider that exposes one** — Ollama multi-source parsing (`details.context_length` on 0.32.x, `general`/`llama`/family-keyed `model_info`) + bounded `/api/show` fallback (max 8 lookups — live-verified `gemma4:e4b` → 131,072); Gemini `inputTokenLimit` (gated on `generateContent`); NIM `max_model_len` (vLLM-backed); Groq documented as not exposing one; 3,404 tests |
| **v1.60.3** | Aug 2026 | **Reasoning traces + failure-lesson memory + goal-fidelity planning** — P0 per-step reasoning-trace capture (`agent-nuvira trace list/show/replay/clear` + dashboard 🔍 Reasoning Traces panel: agent × model × prompt digest × tokens × latency × routing snapshot); P1 self-improver distills negative trajectories into episodic failure-lesson memory injected into future planning prompts; **planner goal-fidelity guard** rejects off-topic / few-shot-regurgitated plans (the NVDA-addon failure mode) with an actionable error; **planner-repair model escalation** re-routes a failed planner through the Auto router at the next complexity level; 3,447 tests |
| **v1.60.4** | Aug 2026 | **Per-task repair model escalation for ALL agents** — the stronger-model escalation that fixed planner failures now applies to writer/debugger/security/tester/reviewer: a failing task's repair is handed a re-routed LLM at the next complexity level, climbing from the ROUTED complexity (latched per task id) so repair is always strictly above the tier that failed; `createEscalatedLLM` is the single shared escalation primitive; 3,452 tests |
| **v1.61.0** | Aug 2026 | **Routing + config-hygiene program (Issues 001–004)** — (1) **ALL 17+ configured providers join routing** via a dynamic `provider-catalog.ts` single source of truth (21 providers: env var, base URL, OpenAI-compat, keyless, capabilities, pricing, context window) + a generic `OpenAICompatAdapter`; nothing is hardcoded — whatever the user keys up is what the router scores; (2) **the router now leverages the data it already gathers** — registry pre-filters degrade dead providers (0 verified + ≥3 unavailable), the Thompson-sampling bandit is ON by default, context-window sources are transparent, and decision explanations cite the registry counts that excluded a provider; (3) **router tech fires at ALL action points** — `agent-nuvira plan` / `eval --routing` / `benchmark` / `model explain` / `edit --auto-route` now resolve through the shared `buildAutoResolveOptions()` full feature set (bandit, quota-ledger, runtime stats, cost/speed/reasoning floors, escalation, paid gate, context preflight) instead of degraded paths; (4) **invalid API keys are auto-cleared + stale local models purged** — a provider with 3 consecutive 401/403s has its dead key removed from config (or told which env var to fix) with a clear error, and `agent-nuvira models refresh` prunes local models that were deleted (`ollama rm`) — verified entries are demoted (telemetry preserved) rather than hard-deleted; 3,510 tests |
| **v1.59.4** | Aug 2026 | P6 M6.6 Software Bill of Materials: `agent-nuvira sbom` (CycloneDX 1.5 from lockfile, `--reproducible` pins), `sbom verify` (drift/tamper), `sbom licenses` (copyleft/unknown audit), `doctor --enterprise` Supply Chain check; 3,313 tests |
| **v1.59.5** | Aug 2026 | Dashboard surfaces mid-stream flakiness end-to-end: violet `⏸ flaky N%` chips on registry rows (mirroring the CLI's `model explain` chip), `⏸ N flaky` provider badges, and a **Flaky mid-stream** stats card — the exact signal `routing.partialFlakiness` uses to deprioritize providers; 3,313 root tests |
| **v1.59.9** | Aug 2026 | **Config-path consistency** — `BUFF_CONFIG_DIR` is now honored by the config manager, dashboard server readers, and vector-store backend picker via one shared resolver (explicit dir > `$BUFF_CONFIG_DIR` > `~/.buff`); hermetic/alternate-config runs can never leak into the real `~/.nuvira/nuvirarc.json`; 3,367 root tests |
| **v1.59.8** | Aug 2026 | P6 M6.4 **Nuvira Gateway (minimal slice)** — federation handshake becomes token-verified (`--auth oidc` + `JwtOidcAdapter`, dependency-free RS256 JWT check; PEM path persists for daemon restart) + dashboard **RBAC identity card** (whoami mirror) + **secrets hardening** (`doctor --enterprise` flags plaintext `apiKeys` arrays) + admin guard-coverage parity test; 3,363 root tests |
| **v1.59.7** | Aug 2026 | P6 M6.1 **RBAC** — `agent-nuvira admin role add/remove/list` + `whoami` (admin/operator/viewer permission matrix over the admin surface; OIDC adapter interface; legacy single-user stays permissive until roles assigned) + dashboard **governance policy card** (live `routing.governance.*`) + CLI **flakiness trend tags** (`healing`/`worsening` in `models status`); 3,348 root tests |
| **v1.59.6** | Aug 2026 | P6 M6.5 **Admin governance API** (`agent-nuvira admin policy/allow/deny/allow-model/deny-model/max-cost/pii-min/unblock/clear` over the M2.4 policy) + dashboard **flakiness healing sparklines** (per-entry `partialHistory` trajectory, never hard-wiped) + Requests panel `⏸ N` partial chips (partials excluded from error rate); 3,328 root tests |
| **v1.59.3** | Aug 2026 | `config set routing.<gate>` now accepts the boolean soft-signal keys (`capabilityFit`, `contextFit`, `partialFlakiness`); 3,286 tests |
| **v1.59.2** | Aug 2026 | P4 M4.4 partial flakiness now feeds the ROUTER: registry `partialRate` EMA (bumped by mid-stream interruptions, healed by clean successes, never flips status) → reliability penalty (capped 40%) gated by `routing.partialFlakiness` (default ON) + transparent `⏸ flaky` chip in `models explain`; 3,284 tests |
| **v1.59.1** | Aug 2026 | Dashboard: P4 M4.4 partial mid-stream interruption chips surface end-to-end (violet `⏸` timeline segment, day chips with streamed-chunk tooltip, per-action Partial section + stat); 3,276 tests |
| **v1.59.0** | Aug 2026 | P6 Enterprise Hardening begins: M6.2 secret-redaction scrubber (every log + audit line scrubbed; `BUFF_NO_REDACT` debug escape) + M6.3 tamper-evident SHA-256 hash-chained audit (`agent-nuvira audit verify/export`, sidecar head state, legacy-compat) — `doctor --enterprise` audit checks now detect tampering with the exact line; 3,275 tests |
| **v1.58.9** | Aug 2026 | P7 M7.4 opt-in gateway telemetry/usage-health flags (`routing.gatewayTelemetry.enabled` + `healthFlags`, OFF by default, privacy-safe — aggregates only, never prompt content) surfaced via `doctor --enterprise`; 3,232 tests |
| **v1.58.8** | Aug 2026 | **Permanent fix for the persistent dashboard "server unreachable / Failed to fetch" issue** — server now binds BOTH IPv4 + IPv6 loopback (macOS resolves `localhost` → ::1 first), CLI opens deterministic 127.0.0.1 |
| **v1.58.7** | Aug 2026 | M4.4 conservative compression (lossless-for-code, off by default) + `partial` mid-stream telemetry + `agent-nuvira doctor --enterprise` self-check (gateway, secrets, audit, RBAC) + upgrade guide (P7 M7.2) |
| **v1.58.6** | Aug 2026 | Fixed `routing.*` config never surviving a reload — `loadConfig` now merges the routing section (bandit/quota/governance/contextWindows/nuviraSidecar), so `agent-nuvira config set routing.*` persists across restarts (regression test) |
| **v1.58.5** | Aug 2026 | P5 config-key support — `agent-nuvira config set routing.nuviraSidecar.enabled\|image` (additive M5.4 keys; 2 new config tests) |
| **v1.58.4** | Aug 2026 | Nuvira-Router **P5 sidecar** (docker-compose.nuvira.yml profile + `agent-nuvira doctor --nuvira` probe; nuvira joins the auto-router provider universe with a neutral profile; keyless gateways supported) + **P4 resilience core** (mid-stream continuation retry — buffered tokens + bounded continue-note on chat auto-failover, reasoning-replay cache with SSE `reasoning_content` capture, context-relay summaries); 3,300+ tests |
| **v1.58.3** | Aug 2026 | Nuvira-Router P3: dashboard **Requests panel** (per provider×model×action request stats — failures, avg/p50/p95/p99 latency, measured spend from the cost ledger) + **`models explain --since <ref>` decision diff** (before→after candidate score changes, winner changes); 3,161+ tests + 54 dashboard component tests |
| **v1.58.2** | Aug 2026 | Models dashboard "Failed to fetch" repeat fix — the panel fetch is now resilient: per-fetch timeouts, independent health/registry fetches (one failing never hides the other), auto-retry with backoff on transient network failures, and fast self-healing re-poll after a failure (no more stuck error banner); 3,161 tests + 48 dashboard component tests |
| **v1.58.1** | Aug 2026 | Dashboard mirrors the CLI `model explain` guarantees — the Auto Router panel renders the M2.x chips (🎯 fit / 📏 measured·📐 estimated / ⏳ ctx) on every provider row, served by `/api/routing` + `/api/all`; docs sync (`MODELS_EXPLAIN_DEMO.md` dashboard section); 3,161 tests + 45 dashboard component tests |
| **v1.58.0** | Aug 2026 | Nuvira-Router P2: capability-aware scoring (`routing.capabilityFit` gate), wire-token measured-cost inputs (real `usage` tokens beat the 2,000/500 estimate; `models explain` shows 📏 measured vs 📐 estimated), multi-account key rotation (multiple `apiKeys` per provider, dead accounts parked + skipped, `tests/e2e/key-rotation`), governance constraints (`routing.governance` — provider/model allow-allow & deny lists, admin per-call max-cost cap, PII-domain block; hard policy violations refuse to serve with `PIIPolicyError`/`GovernancePolicyError`), context-length preflight (`routing.contextFit` — nominal window vs estimated payload, `⏳ ctx N%` chip in `models explain`); also ships the dashboard `--force` + `--port` fixes previously staged as v1.57.0 (never published); 3,159 tests + 42 dashboard component tests |
| **v1.57.0** | Aug 2026 | `agent-nuvira dashboard --force` — detect a STALE dashboard on the port (API/SSE mismatch: /api/model-registry answers SPA HTML instead of JSON) and offer to restart it: probe classifies port state (current dashboards and non-dashboard processes are never touched), confirms, finds the PID, kills it, waits for the port to free, and re-binds a fresh server; also fixed the pre-existing `--port` bug — the server bound the import-time 3030 default, now it resolves the bind at call time from explicit overrides; 3,032 tests + 42 dashboard component tests |
| **v1.56.1** | Aug 2026 | Dashboard Models-panel crash fix — "Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<'" when a stale dashboard server returns SPA HTML for an unknown /api/* route: unknown /api/* now returns a JSON 404, all /api/* responses parse through a shared defensive helper (Content-Type check + try/catch, optional sections degrade to hidden), and `agent-nuvira dashboard` logs a clear EADDRINUSE message instead of crashing; 3,011 tests + 42 dashboard component tests |
| **v1.56.0** | Aug 2026 | Dashboard per-action telemetry timeline is now scrubbable — drag across days, click a day, or use the range slider to see that day's exact verified/killed chips (which provider × model each action killed or verified), with ▶ play/pause day-by-day sweep; timeline day buckets carry deduped raw events end-to-end; 3,011 tests + 39 dashboard component tests |
